# THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED, AND COMPLETELY NON FUNCTIONAL FOR ANYTHING PAST THE ROVER RUCKUS SEASON.
**PLEASE CHECK OUT [EASYOPENCV](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV), WHICH LETS YOU USE OPENCV IN FTC.
IT HAS GREAT EXPLANATORY EXAMPLES THAT CAN BE ADAPTED TO WHATEVER THE CURRENT SEASON IS.**

# DogeCV
[![](https://jitpack.io/v/dogecv/dogecv.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#dogecv/dogecv)

An easy to use computer vision library used for FTC Games to detect game objects. 
Based on [EasyOpenCV](https://github.com/OpenFTC/EasyOpenCV) and OpenCV. 

## Project Status:
**No Longer Developed**

# DISCLAIMER
### THIS REPO IS STILL UNDER CONTINUOUS DEVELOPMENT. WE WILL BE ADDING FURTHER DOCUMENTATION, BUG FIXES, AND NEW FEATURES
### To run this library, you need an SDK version of at least 5.1
### Unfortunately, this library will not work on the ZTE phones, as OpenCV does not work on KitKat.
### Unfortunately, the video tutorials, are outdated and will be updated soon. Please read the installation directions and be check out the examples inside the code. Please contact any of the developed if you need help!

## Videos (OUTDATED!!!)
Wizards.exe have been amazing with their DogeCV coverage, so please check them out and give your support, the videos are easy to understand and well made, great for people who want to learn DogeCV for past versions. Please do keep in mind that these tutorials are for older versions of DogeCV and will not work for the newest version.

# Detectors Status
- **Stone Detector** - Implemented. Needs improvement.
- **Skystone Detector** - Implemented. Not Reliable, Under rewrite.

## Install (Credit to EasyOpenCV)
1. Pull up Android Studio, with the FTC application SDK open
2. Go to the root `build.gradle`
3. To the repositories section, add the lines 
```groovy
allprojects {
  repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' } // this line!
  }
}
```
3. Add the line `implementation 'com.github.dogecv:dogecv:2020.4-alpha'` to TeamCode's `build.release.gradle`, inside the dependencies block
7. Press the `Sync Now` button that should appear in the top right
8. Because EasyOpenCv depends on OpenCV-Repackaged, you will also need to copy [libOpenCvNative.so](https://github.com/OpenFTC/OpenCV-Repackaged/blob/master/doc/libOpenCvNative.so) from the `/doc` folder of that repo into the `FIRST` folder on the internal storage of the Robot Controller.


## Known Issues
(These issues are referring to the 2019-2020 FTC Year Detectors, and not the Relic Recovery or Rover Ruckus ones as those are no longer supported)
- Skystone detectors aren't accurate 
- Stone detectors aren't accurate

## Planned Features / TODO
- Expand Wiki
- Add in distance scoring between samples to increase accuracy
- General Code Clean up
- Basic angle/positioning of elements
- Port Old detectors to new systems
- Better Safety checks
- New Frame Input System
- ML detectors

## FAQ
- **Can I still use classic OpenCV?**
    Yes! We want teams to use DogeCV to learn about vision and start to create their own vision systems. That's why OpenCV is open in all layers of DogeCV, and we keep the classic OpenCvPipepline introduced in the EasyOpenCV library.
- **Can I use a webcam?**
    Once more, yes! See the DogeQuickStart and the wiki for an explanation of how to this.

## Changelogs
**2020.1-alpha**:
 - Changed to EasyOpenCV from EnderCV (thanks OpenFTC team!)
 - Added `StoneDetector`
 - Added `SkystoneDetector`
 - Removed legacy detectors (may be added back later)
 - Added `DigitalCamera` class for localization
 
**2019.1**:
 - Complete re-work of the `Dogeforia` system. It is now integrated within the `OpenCVPipeline` class, and is much simpler.
 - Implemented image cropping, see `CroppingExample`
 - Fixed miss-rotation in Vuforia display. The image should now be correctly oriented on the RC display
 - Added `VuMarkExample` OpMode to demonstrate the basics of the new system
 - Added `WebcamGoldExample` OpMode to demonstrate how to use a webcam with a detector under the new system
 - Added `GoldAndVuMarks
 - Added `CroppingExample` OpMode, intended to ease image cropping and to showcase functionality
 - Added `GoldExample` OpMode
 - Added method `getYPosition()` to `GoldAlignDetector`
 - Added `VuMarkDetector` to provide a ready-made detector for the VuMarks within DogeCV. I will have it highlight VuMarks at a later date
 - Added enum `VuMark` to `DogeCV` to make dealing with VuMarks easier in code
 - Added enum 'CameraMode` to `DogeCV` to make setting the camera between `FRONT`, `BACK`, and `WEBCAM` easier
 - Added wiki entries for VuMarks and Webcams
 - Reworked code comments
 - Removed camera index as a constructor argument in `OpenCVPipeline`. This has been replaced by `DogeCV.CameraMode`
 - Updated page banner - thanks Nathan!
 - Updated this `README`

**2018.2.1 HOTFIX**:
 - Removed `AsyncFilterRunner` import from Sampling Detector #12   
 - Fixed `Dogeforia` crash on stop #10        

**2018.2**:
 - Added `HoughSilverDetector`: intended for slighter slower but more precise silver mineral classification. Works nicely.
 - Added JavaDocs and in-depths comments on most detectors, scorers, and filters
 - Changed `DogeCVScorer` input from MatOfPoint to Mat in order to facilitate more diverse scoring methods
 - Detectors now have a seperate `displayMat` as opposed to a `workingMat`; one is for detection work, the other is for displaying the results
 - Added `SilverExample` OpMode for demonstrating silver detector use
 - Added `HoughSilverExample` OpMode for demonstrating Hough transform-based silver detector use
 - Gold Align Detector now has `setAlignSettings(int offset, int width)` function to set parameters

 - Added an experimental `WHITE` option to `LeviColorFilter`
 - Cleaned up detectors and filters

**2018.1**:
 - Added `HSVRangeFilter` that uses classic `lower` and `upper` HSV ranges
 - `HSVColorFilter` now divides the range by 2 on each side of the perfect color value. (Now range acts as expected) (Issue #9)
 - Added `SilverDetector` (Same as Gold but for silver)
 - Moved `SamplingOrderDetector` to use `HSVRangeFilter` for silver
 - Tuned Sampling (Still not competition ready)
 - Cleaned up `Dogeforia` handling per suggestions of "@BillTheCat123 | Mentor | 3763" on FTC Discord
 - Fixed Gradle import issues of `:FTCRobotController` with `Dogeforia` class. (Issue #8)
 - Cleaned up Gradle Build files to lessen import errors

 - New Versioning System
 - New Scoring API
 - New DogeCVDetector Class
 - Vuforia Support
 - Gold Align, Mineral Order, and Gold Detectors
 - General Code Cleanup
 - Cleaner Params
 - Moved Downscaling to DogeCVDetector Class
